# WellTrack — Implementation Log

## What this document is

This is a step-by-step build log for the WellTrack project, written so that someone who is
**new to web development** can read it and understand not just *what* was done, but *why*
it was done that way. Think of it as a training manual that happens to be built alongside
the real project.

Each entry below corresponds to one completed task from [Tasks.md](Tasks.md) and follows
the same shape:

- **Task** — which checklist item this covers.
- **Background / concepts** — plain-language explanations of any tool, term, or idea used
  in this step, especially the first time it shows up.
- **What was done** — the actual actions taken, in order.
- **Why it's needed** — how this step fits into the bigger picture of "an app users can log
  into and use."
- **Decisions** — choices that had more than one reasonable answer, and the reasoning.
- **Verification** — how we proved it actually works, not just that files were created.

Entries are in chronological order, oldest first. Concepts are usually only explained in
full the *first* time they appear — later entries link back rather than repeat themselves.

## 2026-08-14 — Phase 0: Initialize the git repository and folder layout

**Task:** [Tasks.md](Tasks.md) → Phase 0 → "Initialize a git repository and monorepo
layout"

### Background / concepts

- **Git** is a *version control system*. It takes snapshots ("commits") of your code over
  time, so you can see history, undo mistakes, and work on changes safely without losing
  earlier versions. Almost every professional software project uses it. Running `git init`
  turns an ordinary folder into a git-tracked project by creating a hidden `.git` folder
  that stores all that history.
- A **repository** (or "repo") is just the project folder once git is tracking it.
- A **monorepo** is a single repository that holds more than one related project — in our
  case, the website the user sees (**frontend**) and the server that stores/serves their
  data (**backend**) — instead of splitting them into two separate repositories. The
  alternative, "polyrepo," would mean two separate git projects that have to be checked out
  and versioned independently. For a small MVP built by one team, a monorepo is simpler:
  one place to clone, one place to open in an editor, one history that shows how frontend
  and backend changed together.
- **Frontend** = the part of the application that runs in the user's browser (what they see
  and click). **Backend** = the part that runs on a server, handles requests, talks to the
  database, and enforces rules like "you can only see your own data."
- A **`.gitignore`** file tells git which files/folders to *never* track — e.g. dependency
  folders that can be regenerated (`node_modules/`), build output (`dist/`), and secrets
  (`.env` files containing passwords/keys). Without this, it's easy to accidentally commit
  a secret key to git history, which is hard to fully undo later.
- A **`README.md`** is the front door of a repository — usually the first file anyone
  (including future-you) reads. It should explain what the project is and how to run it.

### What was done

1. Ran `git init` in the project root — there was no git repository yet.
2. Created two empty top-level folders, `/frontend` and `/backend`, to hold the two
   projects. (Git doesn't track empty folders, so a placeholder `.gitkeep` file was added
   to each so they show up once committed.)
3. Wrote [README.md](README.md) explaining the monorepo layout and the local dev steps
   (start the database → run the backend → run the frontend).
4. Added a root `.gitignore` covering `node_modules/`, build output (`dist/`, `build/`),
   `.env` files, log files, and the local Claude Code tooling folder (`.claude/`), so none
   of those ever get committed by accident.

### Why it's needed

Nothing runs yet at this point — this step is purely about setting up a safe, organized
foundation before any real code is written: a place for history to be recorded (git), a
place for the two halves of the app to live (`/frontend`, `/backend`), and guardrails so
secrets and generated files don't end up in version control.

### Decisions

- **Monorepo over separate repos.** Reason: simpler to keep frontend and backend in sync
  while both are changing quickly during early MVP development. Requirements document
  explicitly allowed either approach.
- **No commit made yet.** `git init` starts a repository with zero history. We deliberately
  held off on the first commit until there was a coherent, working chunk of code — an empty
  folder skeleton isn't very meaningful to look back on later. (The first real commit will
  likely happen once the backend and/or frontend scaffolding is confirmed working.)

### State at end of this step

Git repository initialized, no commits yet. `/frontend` and `/backend` exist but are empty.

### Verification

Not applicable — there was no code to build or run yet, only folders and documentation.

## 2026-08-14 — Phase 0: Scaffold the backend (Node.js + Express + TypeScript)

**Task:** [Tasks.md](Tasks.md) → Phase 0 → "Scaffold backend: Node.js + Express +
TypeScript project"

### Background / concepts

- **Node.js** is a program that lets JavaScript run outside a web browser — e.g. as a
  server on a computer, listening for requests. Our backend is a Node.js program.
- **npm** ("Node Package Manager") is the tool that comes with Node.js for installing
  reusable code written by other people (called *packages* or *dependencies*), and for
  running project scripts. `npm init -y` creates a `package.json` file, which is the
  "identity card" of a Node project: its name, version, dependency list, and the commands
  (`scripts`) you can run against it (like `npm run dev`).
- **Dependencies vs. devDependencies**, both listed in `package.json`:
  - *Dependencies* are packages the app needs to actually run in production (e.g.
    `express`, the web server library itself).
  - *devDependencies* are packages only needed while developing (e.g. TypeScript's compiler,
    or a tool that auto-restarts the server on file changes) — they aren't needed once the
    app is built and running for real users.
- **Express** is a small, very widely used library for building web servers in Node.js. It
  lets you define *routes* — "when a request comes in for this URL and this HTTP method, run
  this function and send back a response." Almost every backend endpoint in this project
  (login, save a symptom log, fetch trends, etc.) will be an Express route.
- **TypeScript** is JavaScript with an added *type system*. Plain JavaScript lets you write
  `user.emial` (typo) and it will only fail when that exact line runs, maybe in production
  in front of a real user. TypeScript checks these kinds of mistakes *before* the code ever
  runs, while you're still writing it, which catches a large class of bugs early — especially
  valuable in a health-data app where a silent bug could mean a user's data is recorded
  wrong. Because browsers and Node.js don't understand TypeScript directly, it has to be
  *compiled* ("transpiled") into plain JavaScript first.
- **`tsconfig.json`** configures the TypeScript compiler: which JavaScript version to target,
  how strict the type checking should be, where source files live (`src`), and where
  compiled output should go (`dist`). We turned on `"strict": true`, which enables the
  full set of TypeScript's safety checks — the recommended setting for any new project.
- **`cors`** (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a browser security rule: by default, a
  webpage served from one address (e.g. `http://localhost:5173`, our future frontend) is not
  allowed to make requests to a server on a different address (e.g. `http://localhost:4000`,
  our backend) unless the backend explicitly says "requests from other origins are allowed."
  The `cors` package adds the necessary permission headers so our frontend will actually be
  able to talk to our backend once both exist.
- **`dotenv`** loads configuration values (like a port number, or later, database
  passwords and secret keys) from a local `.env` file into the running program, instead of
  hard-coding them in the source code. This matters because `.env` is git-ignored — secrets
  never get committed — while an example file, **`.env.example`**, *is* committed, listing
  which variables are needed (with placeholder/blank values) so anyone setting up the
  project knows what to configure.
- **`ts-node-dev`** runs a TypeScript project directly (compiling on the fly) and
  automatically restarts the server whenever a source file changes — similar in spirit to
  the commonly-known tool `nodemon`, but with built-in TypeScript support. This is a
  developer convenience only (a `devDependency`); it's not used when the app is actually
  deployed.
- A **health-check endpoint** (here, `GET /api/health`) is a minimal route that just replies
  "I'm alive" (`{"status":"ok"}`). It doesn't do anything related to the product itself —
  its only purpose is to give us (and later, hosting platforms) an easy way to confirm the
  server is running and reachable.

### What was done

1. Ran `npm init -y` inside `/backend`, generating `backend/package.json`.
2. Installed the packages the running app needs (dependencies): `express`, `cors`,
   `dotenv`.
3. Installed packages only needed for development (devDependencies): `typescript`,
   `ts-node-dev`, plus **type definition** packages `@types/node`, `@types/express`,
   `@types/cors`. (Type definitions are separate small packages that describe the shapes of
   a JavaScript library's functions/objects for TypeScript, since the underlying libraries
   themselves are written in plain JavaScript.)
4. Added `backend/tsconfig.json` telling TypeScript: read source from `src/`, write
   compiled JavaScript to `dist/`, and enable strict type checking.
5. Created `backend/src/app.ts` — builds and configures the Express application: turns on
   `cors`, turns on JSON request-body parsing (so the server can read data sent by the
   frontend as JSON), and defines the one route so far, `GET /api/health`.
6. Created `backend/src/index.ts` — the actual entry point that starts the server: loads
   `.env` values, then calls `app.listen(port)` to start accepting real network requests on
   a port (default `4000`).
7. Added `backend/.env.example` documenting the one environment variable used so far,
   `PORT`.
8. Added three npm scripts to `package.json`:
   - `npm run dev` → starts the server with auto-restart-on-change, for local development.
   - `npm run build` → compiles the TypeScript in `src/` into plain JavaScript in `dist/`.
   - `npm start` → runs the already-compiled JavaScript (`dist/index.js`) — this is how the
     app would actually run in production, where nothing gets compiled on the fly.

### Why it's needed

This is the skeleton every backend feature in this project will be built on top of: a
server that can receive HTTP requests and send back responses. Every future endpoint in
[Tasks.md](Tasks.md) (register, login, save a symptom log, fetch the dashboard, etc.) is
just another Express route added to this same app. Getting this foundation right —
TypeScript for safety, environment variables for configuration/secrets, a working dev
loop — makes every later step faster and less error-prone.

### Decisions

- **Split `app.ts` from `index.ts`.** `app.ts` only builds and configures the Express app
  object; `index.ts` is the only file that actually starts listening on a network port.
  Reason: later, in Phase 13 (automated testing), test code needs to send fake requests
  directly into the app *without* starting a real server on a real port. Keeping the "build
  the app" logic separate from the "start listening" logic makes that possible, and is a
  common, well-understood pattern in Express projects.
- **`moduleResolution: "Bundler"` in `tsconfig.json`.** The version of TypeScript installed
  (7.x, very new) removed the older `"node"` option we tried first (it now errors with
  `TS5108`). `"Bundler"` is the modern replacement that works correctly with our setup
  (`module: "commonjs"` + `esModuleInterop`). This is a low-level compiler detail — it
  doesn't change any application behavior, just which internal algorithm TypeScript uses to
  find imported files.

### State at end of this step

`/backend` is a working Express + TypeScript project with exactly one route
(`GET /api/health`). No database connection, no authentication, no real product features
yet — those come in later phases.

### Verification

Writing code is not the same as knowing it works, so every step includes a verification
pass:

1. **`npm run build`** — compiled the TypeScript with no errors, producing
   `backend/dist/app.js` and `backend/dist/index.js`.
2. **`node dist/index.js`** — ran the *compiled* server (the same thing that would happen
   in production) and confirmed it printed `Backend listening on port 4000`.
3. **`curl http://localhost:4000/api/health`** — sent a real HTTP request to the running
   server and got back `{"status":"ok"}`, confirming the route works end-to-end.
4. Stopped the test server process afterward and confirmed port `4000` was freed, so it
   wouldn't be left running in the background or conflict with future runs.
